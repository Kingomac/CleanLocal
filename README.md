- Remove selected folders from those directories.
- Create a whitelist to make it faster.
Future features:
- Add Local\Packages folder to clean UWP applications data.

It requires permission to access the complete file system of Windows, it's just to make it easier, so the user doesn't have to choose the folders to clean manually.
